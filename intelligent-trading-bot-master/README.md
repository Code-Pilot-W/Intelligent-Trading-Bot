# Intelligent Trading Bot

[![Telegram](https://img.shields.io/badge/Telegram-2CA5E0?logo=telegram&style=for-the-badge&logoColor=white)](https://t.me/intelligent_trading_signals) ðŸ“ˆ **[Intelligent Trading Signals](https://t.me/intelligent_trading_signals)** ðŸ“‰ **<https://t.me/intelligent_trading_signals>**

The project aims to develop an intelligent trading bot for automated cryptocurrency trading using advanced machine learning (ML) algorithms and feature engineering. It includes functionalities such as:

* Defining derived features with custom (Python) functions including technical indicators
* Analyzing historic data and training ML models in batch mode
* Analyzing predicted scores and selecting optimal signal parameters
* Generating buy-sell signals by applying trained models in real-time
* Executing trades based on generated signals

## Intelligent Trading Channel

The signaling service operates in the cloud and sends signals to this Telegram channel:

ðŸ“ˆ **[Intelligent Trading Signals](https://t.me/intelligent_trading_signals)** ðŸ“‰ **<https://t.me/intelligent_trading_signals>**

Subscribers can view the signals generated by the bot.

**Current Bot Configuration:**

* Exchange: Binance
* Cryptocurrency: â‚¿ Bitcoin
* Analysis Frequency: 1 minute
* Score Range: -1 to +1 (negative for decrease, positive for increase)
* Filter: Notifications if score > Â±0.20
* Signal Notation: One increase/decrease sign per 0.05 step above the filter threshold

Example notifications:

> â‚¿ 24,518 ðŸ“‰ðŸ“‰ðŸ“‰ Score: -0.26

> ðŸŸ¢ BUY: â‚¿ 24,033 Score: +0.34

## Training ML Models (Offline)

![Batch Data Processing Pipeline](docs/images/fig_1.png)

Scripts to run for training and preparing models:

1. `python -m scripts.download_binance -c config.json`
2. `python -m scripts.merge -c config.json`
3. `python -m scripts.features -c config.json`
4. `python -m scripts.labels -c config.json`
5. `python -m scripts.train -c config.json`
6. `python -m scripts.signals -c config.json`
7. `python -m scripts.train_signals -c config.json`

## Downloading and Merging Source Data

* Download latest historic data: `python -m scripts.download_binance -c config.json`
* Merge datasets: `python -m scripts.merge -c config.json`

## Generate Features and Labels

* Generate features: `python -m scripts.features -c config.json`
* Generate labels: `python -m scripts.labels -c config.json`

## Train Prediction Models

* Train models: `python -m scripts.train -c config.json`

## Signal Generation

Signals are based on aggregated scores from multiple ML models.

* Start service: `python -m service.server -c config.json`

## Hyper-Parameter Tuning

Optimize ML models and signal generation thresholds with:

* Rolling predictions: `python -m scripts.predict_rolling -c config.json`
* Train signal models: `python -m scripts.train_signals -c config.json`

## Configuration Parameters

Configuration files include:
* `service.App.py` and `-c config.json` for configuration
